## Refactoring and improving Horiseon's codebase to accessibility standards resulting in effective SEO and long-term sustainability.

## Description
    This project was assigned to refactor Horiseon Marketing's code to accessibility standards-- resulting in effective SEO and long-term sustainability. Also, I refactored the structure of the HTML, as well as the CSS for easier readability. The code was redundant, so I shortened and grouped together elements for easier readability.
